Avro support for Erlang (http://avro.apache.org/).

Current version implements Apache Avro 1.7.5 specification.

Technical information
---------------------

Every value is stored together with its type in #avro_value{} record where data
has different meaning depending on the type. It is recommended to use ?AVRO_VALUE*
macros defined in erlavro.hrl to work with this record.

Set of macros are used to check types of values or types themselves:
?AVRO_IS_*_TYPE(T) checks that T is a specified type.
?AVRO_IS_*_VALUE(V) checks that the value has specified type.
Such macros can be used in external code to speed up matching.

Erlang version doesn't make a difference between float and double values.

To do
-----

This version of library supports only subset of all functionality needed to
export data from BIX. What things should be done:

1. Decoding of JSON data.
2. Support of binary encoder/decoder.
3. Different runtime checks: type check during assignments,
   names checks, etc.
4. Parsing Canonical Form.
5. Object (avro_schema) to manage all types included in the schema,
   with consistency checks, etc. (DONE without consistency checks).
6. Better coverage of possible operations by modules, so ?AVRO_VALUE*
   macros are not exposed to external code.
7. Support of automatic default values assignment for records.
8. Automatic types inferring (t.ex. avro:value_from(X) instead of avro_primitive:Type(X)).
